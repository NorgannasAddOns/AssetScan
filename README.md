# AssetScan

AssetScan is an iOS barcode scanning appliction that is designed (unlike most other barcode applications out there) for asset tagging and inventory management purposes.

This software is not what you're looking for if you're after a UPC / EAN shopping information style appliction that finds what kind of food thing you just scanned at the shops.

If however, you're looking for something that will scan QR, Code38, really long Code128's, Databar, or PDF417 serial / modeal codes off your boxes, laptops, desktops, monitors, keyboards or asset labels for entry into your favourite asset / inventory management system, then this is the right app for you.

## Compiling from code

The code is simple to compile if you have a Apple developer account.

* Clone this repository.
* Install CocoaPod dependencies with `pod install`.
* Open the generated workspace AssetScan.xcworkspace (Note: this is **NOT** the same as AssetScan.xcodeproj)
* Compile and run on your iDevice.

## Prebuilt binary version

If you don't have a developer account, or prefer to not get your hands dirty, you can also find my pre-compiled release version on the app store for your pleasure.

## License
